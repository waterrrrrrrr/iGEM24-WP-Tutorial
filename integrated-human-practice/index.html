Especially due to the aging population, the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases in the world is increasing.</p><p class="underh3">According to the WORLDHEARTREPORT2023 released by the World 
        Heart Federation (WHF), 20.5 million people died of cardiovascular diseases in 
        2021, accounting for about one third of the total number of deaths worldwide.</p>

        <p class="underh3">Heart disease is the main type of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease can be divided into congenital heart disease (congenital malformation) and acquired heart disease. Among them, acquired heart disease accounts for the majority, such as coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, sick sinus syndrome and so on, which causes atrial fibrillation, heart failure and other symptoms.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In the 2019 Global Health Assessment Report released by the 
        World Health Organization (WHO), it is mentioned that in the 20 years from 2000 to 2019, ischemic heart disease was the number one cause of death in humans. And this cause of death has not only been the "number one killer" threatening human health for many years, but also has a clear trend of increase. The most deadly consequence of ischemic heart disease is Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD), a natural death from cardiac causes characterized by a sudden loss of consciousness that occurs within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms. In the United States, it is estimated that about 400,000 people develop SCD each year; According to the China Health Statistical Yearbook 2018, it is estimated that about 544,000 cases of SCD occur in China each year, with more men than women.</p>

        <p class="underh3">At present, the diagnosis of heart disease is mainly based on clinical symptoms (such as chest pain, dyspnea, etc.), physical examination (heart murmur, hypertension, etc.) and electrocardiogram (ECG).</p>

        <p class="underh3">Electrocardiogram (ECG) was the most common cardiac examination performed by the respondents, accounting for 61.19%.</p>
        <p class="underh3">The proportion of respondents who did not have a heart examination was 32.34%, and the reasons for this need to be further understood.</p> 
        <p class="underh3">The proportions of holter electrocardiogram, B ultrasound and CT were 10.45%, 21.39% and 20.9%, respectively.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Coronary angiography was the least cardiac examination performed by the respondents, only 4 people chose it, accounting for 1.99%.</p>     
        <p class="underh3">However, these methods have some shortcomings, such as low timeliness (usually the results can only be diagnosed when the disease is serious), complicated operation, need of professionals and long-term monitoring alone，ect.</p>

        <p class="underh3">It can be seen from the data that most people do not attach 
        much importance to physical examination, and relatively few people maintain regular physical examination habits. This shows that it is very necessary to strengthen health education and physical examination publicity and raise public awareness of the importance of physical examination, and the application of this project product in the early screening of the risk of heart-related diseases is closely related to it.</p>

        <p class="underh3">Our inspiration primarily stems from "An enzyme-free electrochemical sandwich DNA assay based on the use of hybridization chain reaction and gold nanoparticles: application to the determination of the DNA of Helicobacter pylori." The paper utilizes a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to capture target miRNA by binding with stem-loop adapters, leading to signal amplification. Simultaneously, the enrichment of methylene blue (MB) as an electrochemical detection substance not only amplifies the miRNA signal but also converts chemical signals into electrical signals. Additionally, through a paper titled "Combinatorial Selection and Edited Combinatorial Selection of Phosphorothioate Aptamers Targeting Human Nuclear Factor-κB RelA/p50 and RelA/RelA," we learned that phosphorothioate aptamers exhibit higher affinity and stability compared to traditional nucleic acid aptamers. Therefore, we aim to utilize phosphorothioate nucleotides to construct appropriate stem-loop phosphorothioate adapters to meet our miRNA detection needs.</p>

          <div class="cont-h2">Challenges</div>
        </h3> 
        <p class="underh3" style="font-weight: bold;">How to investigate the real needs of the market?</p>
<p class="underh3">It is crucial to understand the real needs of potential users. This requires gathering user feedback and insights through market research, 
user interviews, questionnaires and other methods. When conducting requirements analysis, it is important not only to focus on the surface needs of users, but also to dig deep into their potential needs, pain points, and expectations. This helps to ensure that the product or service developed by the project truly solves the user's problem and meets their needs.</p>
<p class="underh3">In addition to understanding user needs, a comprehensive analysis of the market environment and competition is also required. This includes conducting a survey of competitors for similar products or services to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning. Through comparative analysis, market gaps and opportunities can be found to provide a clearer orientation and development direction for project development.</p>
<p class="underh3">In the early stages of project development, the method of MVP validation can be adopted to test the feasibility and popularity of a product or service. Collect feedback and comments from users by showing them preliminary product prototypes or demonstrations. This feedback can help fine-tune and optimize the product design, ensuring that the direction of the project development is in line with the needs of the user.</p>
<p class="underh3">Market demand is a dynamic process, with the change of time 
and environment, the needs of users will continue to evolve. Therefore, the project development team needs to establish a continuous iteration and feedback loop mechanism. This means constant communication and interaction with users and 
the market, and timely adjustment and optimization of products or services to adapt to changes in market demand. When we execute a project, we need to take into account the real market need, and make sure that this need is objective and 
not our subjective inference.</p>
<p class="underh3" style="font-weight: bold;">How to build customer channels and build long-term connections?</p>
<p class="underh3">First of all, we need to know who the target user is, so that we can establish a targeted customer channel. According to the project positioning and target market, determine the characteristics, needs and behaviors of 
target users. Select a variety of channels suitable for target user groups for 
promotion and marketing. This may include online channels (such as social media, search engine optimization, content marketing), offline channels (such as attending trade shows, hosting events, partner promotions), etc.</p>
<p class="underh3">Completing detection and promoting early screening is the most basic part of our project, and how to build customer channels and establish 
long-term contact with customers is a big challenge.</p>

        <p class="underh3">The combination of customer channel establishment and health monitoring services can provide users with a more comprehensive health management program. By collecting users' health data and behavioral habits, combined with medical expertise and health algorithms, users' health status can be monitored and analyzed in real time. According to the monitoring results, users are provided with personalized health recommendations and management programs, including diet, exercise, lifestyle and other aspects of guidance. This can not only increase the user's health awareness and motivation for behavior change, but also increase the user's dependency and satisfaction with the service.</p>      
<p class="underh3">By establishing integrated health monitoring and advice services, we can gradually build a complete health ecosystem. This ecosystem covers users, medical institutions, health research institutions, insurance companies and other aspects, forming a closed-loop health management system. In the health ecosystem, we can play a key role in providing customized services and solutions to all participants through data analytics, intelligent algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies. This can not only enhance the company's market influence and competitive advantage, but also make a positive contribution to the development and progress of the entire industry.</p>
<p class="underh3" style="font-weight: bold;">How to control the cost of the product, reduce the external 
dependence of the product, and make the production more convenient through technology iteration?</p>
<p class="underh3">Controlling product costs, reducing external dependencies, and making production easier through technological iterations is a complex challenge. In terms of cost control, it is necessary to rationally select materials, optimize production processes, and introduce automation equipment. Reducing external dependence requires a diversified supplier network and vertically integrated production chains. Technology iteration requires continuous research and development innovation and the introduction of intelligent manufacturing technology. At the same time, it is also the key to establish a learning organization 
and train professional and technical personnel. These measures will help improve product quality, reduce production costs, and enhance the company's competitiveness and sustainable development capabilities.</p>
<p class="underh3" style="font-weight: bold;">As a third-party medical testing device, how to balance our 
relationship with the hospital as a product developer?</p>
<p class="underh3">As a third-party medical testing device developer, in addition to establishing a good relationship with hospitals, directly connecting to the consumer side is also one of our important challenges. Consumers' needs and 
expectations for medical testing devices may be different from hospitals, so we need to provide targeted solutions.</p>
<p class="underh3">First, the challenge is to understand the actual needs and expectations of consumers. Consumers' health awareness continues to improve, and they have higher expectations for the performance, ease of use, and price of medical testing devices. At the same time, consumers are extremely concerned about the safety and accuracy of products.</p>
<p class="underh3">In response to these challenges, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our connectivity with consumers. First, through market research and user feedback, we deeply understand the needs and preferences of consumers to ensure that our products can truly meet the needs of users. Secondly, by establishing a sound customer service system, we respond to consumers' consultation and feedback in a timely manner, and provide professional technical support and solutions to enhance consumers' trust in products. In addition, we also 
participate in health exhibitions, hold health lectures and other ways to directly face consumers, improve product visibility and recognition.</p>
<p class="underh3">Through the above comprehensive measures, we strive to establish a stable and long-term relationship in the connection with the consumer side, in order to jointly promote the development and application of medical testing devices, and achieve good interaction and communication between products and users.</p>
