        <p class="underh3">
          For nearly three decades, cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death worldwide. The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing globally, particularly due to ageing populations. According to the WORLD HEART REPORT 2023 released by the World Heart Federation (WHF), 20.5 million people will die from cardiovascular disease in 2021, which is about one third of all deaths worldwide.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          Heart disease is the main type of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease can be divided into congenital heart disease (congenital malformation) and acquired heart disease. Among them, acquired heart disease accounts for the majority, such as coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, sick sinus syndrome, etc., causing atrial fibrillation, heart failure and other symptoms.

        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">
          At present, the diagnosis of heart disease is mainly through clinical symptoms (such as chest pain, dyspnea, etc.), physical examination (heart murmur, hypertension, etc.) and other ways to screen, through electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, etc.

            <p class="underh3">A total of 205 samples were collected in this study, of which 201 were valid.</p>
            <p class="underh3">76.12% of respondents were familiar with heart disease, suffered from it themselves or had heard of someone suffering from it.</p>
            <p class="underh3">Among them, 36.82% of the respondents believe that heart disease is very common and many people have it.</p>
            <p class="underh3">In addition, 23.88% of people think that heart-related diseases are very distant and have not been heard of.</p>
            <p class="underh3">It can be seen that heart-related diseases are common in people's lives, but there are still some people who lack awareness of this.</p>

          <p class="underh3">52.28% of respondents had symptoms of tachycardia, palpitation and palpitation.</p>
          <p class="underh3">However, only 24.26% of respondents with these symptoms had been to the hospital for examination, and 75.74% had not been to the hospital.</p>

          <p class="underh3">The majority of respondents (42.79%) said they rarely visited a hospital for a physical examination, accounting for nearly half of the total.</p>
          <p class="underh3">The proportion of people who have a medical examination at least once a year is 22.89%, indicating that a small number of people attach great importance to medical examination.</p>
          <p class="underh3">29.85% of the respondents chose to have a physical examination every 2-3 years, indicating that a small number of people have maintained a more regular physical examination habit.</p>
          <p class="underh3">The number of people who chose to have a physical examination more than 3 years accounted for 4.48%, which is a relatively small proportion of people.</p>
          <p class="underh3">It can be seen from the data that most people do not attach much importance to physical examination, and relatively few people maintain regular physical examination habits. This shows that it is very necessary to strengthen health education and physical examination publicity and raise public awareness of the importance of physical examination, and the application of this project product in the early screening of the risk of heart-related diseases is closely related to it.</p>

          <p class="underh3">According to the calculation, the average score is 3.14. This means that overall, the participants were at a moderate to high level of concern about their heart damage from overwork.</p>

          <div class="cont-h2">How to investigate the real needs of the market</div>
        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">It is crucial to understand the real needs of potential users. This requires gathering user feedback and insights through market research, 
        user interviews, questionnaires and other methods. When conducting requirements analysis, it is important not only to focus on the surface needs of users, but also to dig deep into their potential needs, pain points, and expectations. This helps to ensure that the product or service developed by the project truly solves the user's problem and meets their needs.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In addition to understanding user needs, a comprehensive analysis of the market environment and competition is also required. This includes conducting a survey of competitors for similar products or services to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning. Through comparative analysis, market gaps and opportunities can be found to provide a clearer orientation and development direction for project development.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In the early stages of project development, the method of MVP validation can be adopted to test the feasibility and popularity of a product or service. Collect feedback and comments from users by showing them preliminary product prototypes or demonstrations. This feedback can help fine-tune and optimize the product design, ensuring that the direction of the project development is in line with the needs of the user.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Market demand is a dynamic process, with the change of time 
        and environment, the needs of users will continue to evolve. Therefore, the project development team needs to establish a continuous iteration and feedback loop mechanism. This means constant communication and interaction with users and 
        the market, and timely adjustment and optimization of products or services to adapt to changes in market demand. When we execute a project, we need to take into account the real market need, and make sure that this need is objective and 
        not our subjective inference.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">First of all, we need to know who the target user is, so that we can establish a targeted customer channel. According to the project positioning and target market, determine the characteristics, needs and behaviors of 
        target users. Select a variety of channels suitable for target user groups for 
        promotion and marketing. This may include online channels (such as social media, search engine optimization, content marketing), offline channels (such as attending trade shows, hosting events, partner promotions), etc.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Completing detection and promoting early screening is the most basic part of our project, and how to build customer channels and establish 
        long-term contact with customers is a big challenge.</p>
        <p class="underh3">The combination of customer channel establishment and health monitoring services can provide users with a more comprehensive health management program. By collecting users' health data and behavioral habits, combined with medical expertise and health algorithms, users' health status can be monitored and analyzed in real time. According to the monitoring results, users are provided with personalized health recommendations and management programs, including diet, exercise, lifestyle and other aspects of guidance. This can not only increase the user's health awareness and motivation for behavior change, but also increase the user's dependency and satisfaction with the service.</p>      
        <p class="underh3">By establishing integrated health monitoring and advice services, we can gradually build a complete health ecosystem. This ecosystem covers users, medical institutions, health research institutions, insurance companies and other aspects, forming a closed-loop health management system. In the health ecosystem, we can play a key role in providing customized services and solutions to all participants through data analytics, intelligent algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies. This can not only enhance the company's market influence and competitive advantage, but also make a positive contribution to the development and progress of the entire industry.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">As a third-party medical testing device developer, in addition to establishing a good relationship with hospitals, directly connecting to the consumer side is also one of our important challenges. Consumers' needs and 
          expectations for medical testing devices may be different from hospitals, so we need to provide targeted solutions.</p>
          <p class="underh3">First, the challenge is to understand the actual needs and expectations of consumers. Consumers' health awareness continues to improve, and they have higher expectations for the performance, ease of use, and price of medical testing devices. At the same time, consumers are extremely concerned about the safety and accuracy of products.</p>
          <p class="underh3">In response to these challenges, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our connectivity with consumers. First, through market research and user feedback, we deeply understand the needs and preferences of consumers to ensure that our products can truly meet the needs of users. Secondly, by establishing a sound customer service system, we respond to consumers' consultation and feedback in a timely manner, and provide professional technical support and solutions to enhance consumers' trust in products. In addition, we also 
          participate in health exhibitions, hold health lectures and other ways to directly face consumers, improve product visibility and recognition.</p>
          <p class="underh3">Through the above comprehensive measures, we strive to establish a stable and long-term relationship in the connection with the consumer side, in order to jointly promote the development and application of medical testing devices, and achieve good interaction and communication between products and users.</p>
