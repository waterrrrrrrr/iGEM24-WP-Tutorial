        <p class="underh3">
          For nearly three decades, cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death worldwide. The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease is increasing globally, particularly due to ageing populations. According to the WORLD HEART REPORT 2023 released by the World Heart Federation (WHF), 20.5 million people will die from cardiovascular disease in 2021, which is about one third of all deaths worldwide.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          Heart disease is the main type of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease can be divided into congenital heart disease (congenital malformation) and acquired heart disease. Among them, acquired heart disease accounts for the majority, such as coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, sick sinus syndrome, etc., causing atrial fibrillation, heart failure and other symptoms.

        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">
          At present, the diagnosis of heart disease is mainly through clinical symptoms (such as chest pain, dyspnea, etc.), physical examination (heart murmur, hypertension, etc.) and other ways to screen, through electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, etc.

          <strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">Most people care about their heart health.<br> 
          Many people are at risk for heart disease and have heart-related symptoms.<br> 
          Many people worry about damage to the heart from work.<br> 
          But only a small number of people will go to the hospital for regular physical examinations and heart checks.</p>
          <p class="underh3"><strong>Data:</strong></p>
          <p class="underh3">A total of 205 samples were collected in this study, of which 201 were valid.</p>
          <p class="underh3">76.12% of respondents were familiar with heart disease, suffered from it themselves or had heard of someone suffering from it.</p>
          <p class="underh3">Among them, 36.82% of the respondents believe that heart disease is very common and many people have it.</p>
          <p class="underh3">In addition, 23.88% of people think that heart-related diseases are very distant and have not been heard of.</p>
          <p class="underh3">It can be seen that heart-related diseases are common in people's lives, but there are still some people who lack awareness of this.</p>

            What do you know about heart-related diseases?
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="underh3">69.04% of the respondents had experienced symptoms related to heart disease.</p>
        <p class="underh3">43.65% of the respondents had symptoms of chest tightness and pain.</p>
        <p class="underh3">52.28% of respondents had symptoms of tachycardia, palpitation and palpitation.</p>
        <p class="underh3">However, only 24.26% of respondents with these symptoms had been to the hospital for examination, and 75.74% had not been to the hospital.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="underh3">The majority of respondents (42.79%) said they rarely visited a hospital for a physical examination, accounting for nearly half of the total.</p>
        <p class="underh3">The proportion of people who have a medical examination at least once a year is 22.89%, indicating that a small number of people attach great importance to medical examination.</p>
        <p class="underh3">29.85% of the respondents chose to have a physical examination every 2-3 years, indicating that a small number of people have maintained a more regular physical examination habit.</p>
        <p class="underh3">The number of people who chose to have a physical examination more than 3 years accounted for 4.48%, which is a relatively small proportion of people.</p>
        <p class="underh3">It can be seen from the data that most people do not attach much importance to physical examination, and relatively few people maintain regular physical examination habits. This shows that it is very necessary to strengthen health education and physical examination publicity and raise public awareness of the importance of physical examination, and the application of this project product in the early screening of the risk of heart-related diseases is closely related to it.</p>

        <p class="underh3">On a scale of one to five, respondents were concerned about their heart damage from overwork.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Worry about the degree distribution is as follows: 1 (12.44%), 2 (15.42%), 3 (33.33%), 4 (23.38%), 5 (15.42%). As can be seen, the option with a worry level of 3 has the highest percentage at 33.33%.</p>
        <p class="underh3">According to the calculation, the average score is 3.14. This means that overall, the participants were at a moderate to high level of concern about their heart damage from overwork.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In summary, the participants' concern about their heart damage due to overwork was moderately high on the whole.</p>
