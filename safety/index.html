        </h2>
        <p class="underh2">This year, we designed telepathy: a multi-sensor rapid detection kit for cardiac diseases, which means that we will use blood as the detection source and adopt the product design of the kit.</p>
        <p class="underh2">Before starting the project, we consider safety from three aspects: experimental design, management, and deployment. Our project, as a cell-free system, effectively avoids some potential biological invasion and infection risks.</p>
        <p class="underh2">However, the project still has certain risks. We analyze that the risks of our project mainly come from: 1) the reagents and experimental operations we use; 2) Product testing and application risks, etc.</p>
        
        <a name="p1-1" style="position: relative; top: -12vh;"></a>

          <div class="cont-h2">Reagent use and experimental operation</div>
        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">We adopt the strategy of nucleic acid aptamer and HCR cascade signal amplification as the core principle of our detection, so we need to use some related reagents. Some of these reagents have certain human or environmental hazards, such as formaldehyde, 2- mercaptoethyl triethoxysilane and gold nanoparticles, so we must pay special attention to them.</p>

        <h3>
          <img src="../static/svgs/subtitle_logo.svg" alt=" " class="subtitlelogo">
          <div class="cont-h2">Product detection and application</div>
        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">Our project involves the application of human blood collection and treatment, so it is necessary to estimate <strong>the biosafety risks related to blood in particular</strong>.</p>
        <p class="underh3">As far as we know, blood tests may cause pain, bleeding, infection and other effects on the body. In addition, improper blood treatment may produce toxic, harmful and infectious substances. If these substances are mixed with domestic garbage, it may pollute the air, water, land, animals and plants, cause the spread of diseases and directly endanger the health of residents.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In addition to blood, we also designed an elution device to 
        ensure the smoothness and recovery of our detection pathway. If the eluent is not handled properly, it may also cause the above-mentioned problems.</p>       
        <p class="underh3">Therefore, we need to take safety measures to deal with the 
        environmental and health impacts and other potential safety risks brought by the project.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Because our products need to be stored at a low temperature 
        (4â„ƒ), users need to put them in the refrigerator. If it is improperly sealed, it may <strong>pollute the food in the refrigerator</strong> and cause safety risks.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In addition, because our test results will be sent to users 
        through mobile phone software and stored in the cloud, we must consider <strong>the information security</strong> of users.</p>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Laboratory supervision and safety training</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">In order to reinforce the management of the labs, the official of our university delivered management regulations. All of our activities are instructed under the official guidance. Besides, our lab also special regulations on management of instruments and equipment, which we must obey during experiments.</p>
        <p class="underh3">To gain access to our lab, we must apply on the lab website 
        and take a test. The test included basic experiment skills, lab cleaning, experimental waste disposal, ethics, chemical reagents storage, lab rules, equipment safety, and emergency measures. Only those who pass the test are allowed to carry out experiments in our lab.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Associate Professor Yang Fan is the instructor of our lab. She has been in charge of our lab for 8 years. She is familiar with most molecule cloning experiments and can offer suggestions at any time. So our experiment 
        specification is under the control of the instructor in order to avoid any possible danger. Before we began our business in the lab, we also had a 'safety education class' delivered by her to train us the specific rules to follow in the 
        lab and how to deal with the possible emergency. When we are carrying out our experiments, our instructor will supervise our experimental operations,decreasing the posibility of unnecessary danger and damages.</p>

        <p class="underh3">Our laboratory has a dedicated lab instructor, who trains us on laboratory procedures, reviews our experimental plans, and ensures compliance with laboratory safety requirements. In addition, ourteam members are vigilant about the general biosafety standards of synthetic biology, consult literature to design more efficient safety modules, and regularly communicate with our 
          mentor todiscuss and optimize product safety.</p>
          <p class="underh3">Our work is carried out in strict accordance with the relevant laws and regulations and campus safety rules.</p>
          <p class="underh3">Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China has 
          released the "Safety Regulations for Higher Education Laboratory" and distributed it to all higher education institutions.[1]</p>
          <p class="underh3">At Zhejiang University, the Laboratory Equipment and Management Department is responsible for the supervision and safety management of all 
          laboratories.[2]</p>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Safe operation of experiments</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">We handed over to the company to construct a nucleic acid library, and then transformed it into a thionucleic acid library using sulfhydrylated reagents, and then used formaldehyde-assisted phase separation (FCSP) to obtain the thionucleic acid aptamer we needed.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Then, we used the obtained aptamers to construct the microarray chip for detection, the electrode material was gold electrode, and the thiolated nucleic acid chain was used for immobilization on the support plate to print the circuit diagrams using the desired conductive material as ink, and then encapsulated and assembled, and assembled into the hardware after separate preparations.</p>
        <p class="underh3">During these processes, all our experimental operations were carried out under supervised conditions, with strict adherence to the relevant reagent usage guidelines and utmost care taken to prevent the risk of environmental dispersion (formaldehyde, etc.) and human inhalation. Disposal of experimental devices and waste is also organized according to laboratory norms.</p>

        <p class="underh3">In order to prevent our assay nucleic acid aptamers and the 
          nucleic acid sequences involved in HCR from posing a certain risk due to environmental exposure, we have designed the immobilization of our assay microarray chip in a certain way: mainly by means of sulfhydrylated nucleic acid chains. After iterative optimization, we used a more stable Au-Se bond instead, thus minimizing the risk of nucleic acid shedding and exposure.</p>
          <p class="underh3">In addition, we follow environmentally friendly principles in the overall design of our products, such as using biodegradable PLA plastic as our encapsulation material to minimize the environmental hazards of production and disposal.</p>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Equipment Safety</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">In order to minimize the risk of contact between users and the interior of our products, we have only the blood collection window open to the users and have modeled the volume of blood to be collected for testing. Moreover, we set an appropriate amount of blood collection through modeling and calculation, and at the same time allow users to clean and disinfect the blood collection window with disinfectants such as alcohol to minimize the risk of blood infection.</p>
        <p class="underh3">This is despite our efforts, such as centralized recycling. 
        However, there is still a certain possibility of improper handling or inadvertent leakage of blood or eluent. When misfortune occurs, thorough disinfection treatment should be carried out on the relevant places in time, such as ultraviolet lamp exposure, alcohol wiping, ventilation, etc., or use nucleic acid scavenger to remove nucleic acid.</p>
        <p class="underh3">In order to prevent safety risks caused by excessively sharp edges of the product, we have done some wrapping treatment.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Finally, we have designed detailed instructions for the use 
        and maintenance of our products based on the principles of safe testing and the risks mentioned above to guide the user in minimizing safety risks.</p> 

        <p class="underh3"><strong>non-traditional security</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">Our project uses the cloud to store the user's test results 
        involves the user's health privacy.</p>
        <p class="underh3">To solve the above problems, we designed a system based on the combination of full-homomorphic encryption algorithm and AES algorithm to realize the storage, management, retrieval and calculation of medical data related to the kit.</p>
        <p class="underh3">The data retrieval calculation method based on full-homomorphic encryption technology can directly perform basic calculation on the encrypted data without decrypting it into plain text, which not only ensures the security of user data, but also ensures that the server can directly operate the stored data ciphertext, balancing the relationship between ensuring the security of user data in the cloud storage system and serving cloud computing. The combination of AES encryption algorithm also effectively makes up for the low encryption rate of all homomorphic encryption algorithm</p>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Our Challenge</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">Since the user's usage is a complex and unknown situation for us, the risk protection setting of our equipment needs to be a trade-off between the user's usage and the security risk level. We need to be able to adapt to the majority of use cases while taking into account the principle of simplicity in product design.</p>
        <p class="underh3">The risk profile of the users of our devices, a key part of 
        our program, determines whether our program is worthwhile for the majority of the population, and for this part of the safety considerations, we need to be more rigorous in our design and to obtain more supportive experimental data through testing.</p>
        <p class="underh3">Ideally, our equipment should be able to pass the inspection of the relevant national government departments, which is something we still need to continue to optimize.</p>
