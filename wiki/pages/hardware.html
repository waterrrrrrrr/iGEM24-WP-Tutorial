        <p class="underh2">
          At present, the diagnosis of heart disease is mainly carried out through screening through clinical symptoms, physical examination, etc., and diagnosis is made through electrocardiogram (ECG). However, these methods have the disadvantages of low timeliness, cumbersome and complex operation, the need for professional personnel, and the need for separate long-term monitoring. Therefore, in order to achieve the purpose of early detection and early treatment and make up for some shortcomings of traditional methods, we need to seek a more rapid and convenient detection method to achieve the effect of general investigation and early detection. To this end, we have designed and developed an electrically inductive rapid diagnostic device, which is a microfluidic biochip packaged in the form of a test strip, which requires only a drop of blood to complete the diagnosis, and outputs an electrical signal via Bluetooth to show the risk of disease and the type of disease on your mobile phone. The entire diagnostic process is non-invasive and very fast, allowing a large number of people to be screened for heart disease in a short period of time.

The reagent chamber is connected to the preliminary mixing chamber, and the platform descends to press the reagent into the mixing chamber, so as to achieve the purpose of automatic quantitative dispensing. This instrument requires a total of three detection reagents, so we have designed three reagent bins to be connected to the mixing bin. In order to prevent accidental mixing of reagents during storage due to improper user handling, we have installed an electric valve at the connection port.

After the initial mixing of the blood sample, the No. 1 valve is opened, and the blood sample enters the chip, and after a period of time, the No. 2 valve opens the blood sample to release, and at the same time, the eluent enters the chip from the reagent compartment for the first elution, and the electrical signal detection is turned on, and the No. 1 valve is opened again after the detection is completed, and the eluent enters the chip, and the valve is closed after the elution is completed, and the diagnosis is completed.
