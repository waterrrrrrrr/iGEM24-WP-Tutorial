        <p class="underh3">Our goal is to educate and raise awareness about science, synthetic biology, heart-related diseases, and other pressing real-world issues, 
            and to encourage them to work on these issues and give back to society. We believe that science and synthetic biology are key to solving major challenges such as heart disease, which in turn is a major factor affecting human health and well-being. We hope that through our products and programs, more people will understand and pay attention to the prevention and treatment of heart disease, as 
            well as the principles and applications of science and synthetic biology, thereby improving their scientific literacy and social responsibility. We also hope 
            to stimulate more people's interest and passion for science and synthetic biology, as well as creativity and innovation for solutions to problems such as heart disease through our products and projects, thus promoting their personal development and social progress.</p>
            <p class="underh3">In order to achieve our goals, we will conduct extensive and in-depth exchanges and contacts with people from all walks of life, as well as carry out various forms and contents of publicity and activities. We will use 
            the web, media, social platforms and other channels to publish and share information and dynamics of our products and projects, as well as scientific and synthetic biology knowledge and anecdotes, in order to attract and expand our audience. We will also use exhibitions, lectures, workshops, competitions and other 
            means to showcase and demonstrate the features and benefits of our products and projects, as well as the principles and practices of science and synthetic biology, to enhance and enhance the engagement and experience of our audience. We 
            will also use partnerships, sponsorships, donations and other avenues to support and reward those who have an interest and talent in science and synthetic biology, as well as those who contribute to problems such as heart disease, to encourage and inspire their learning and creativity.</p>
            <p class="underh3">Our education and popular science communication covers all social strata and all ages, and is committed to making the largest range of people can benefit from us. According to the characteristics and needs of different audience groups, we will customize and adapt the form and content of our publicity and activities to suit and meet their level and interests. We will try to 
            use simple, vivid and interesting language and methods to disseminate and popularize the knowledge and skills of science and synthetic biology, as well as the methods and measures for the prevention and improvement of heart disease. We will try to use interactive, participatory, experiential models and scenarios to show and interpret the mystery and fascination of science and synthetic biology, as well as the dangers and effects of heart disease. We will try to use innovative, creative, creative ideas and examples to inspire and foster scientific 
            and synthetic biology thinking and capabilities, as well as solutions and contributions to heart disease.</p>
            <p class="underh3">We believe that through our educational and popular science 
            communication, we can let more people know and understand science and synthetic biology, as well as heart disease and other issues, thereby improving their scientific literacy and social responsibility. We also believe that through our educational and popular science communication, we can get more people to love and learn about science and synthetic biology, as well as issues such as heart disease, thus promoting their personal development and social progress. We look forward to working with you to make our contributions to science and synthetic biology, as well as issues such as heart disease.</p>

          <p class="underh3">- For primary school students, we can start with the basic concepts and common sense of biology, introduce the basic ideas and application 
          fields of synthetic biology with simple and easy to understand language and vivid examples, such as the use of synthetic biology to manufacture biosensors, biofuels, biological drugs, etc., to stimulate students' interest and curiosity. 
          At the same time, through parent-child activities, games, animations and other 
          ways, we can educate students to understand the structure and function of the heart, understand the importance of heart health, and develop good living habits, such as regular work and rest, reasonable diet, moderate exercise, etc., to prevent the occurrence of heart diseases.</p>
          <p class="underh3">- For middle school students, we can start with the basic principles and methods of biology, introduce the basic principles and methods of 
          synthetic biology with scientifically rigorous language and specific experimental cases, such as the use of synthetic biology to design and build gene circuits, biological devices, biological modules, etc., to cultivate students' scientific literacy and innovation ability. At the same time, through classroom teaching, lectures, videos and other ways, we can educate students to understand the 
          physiology and pathology of the heart, understand the harm of heart disease and preventive measures, such as controlling weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, 
          blood lipids, timely medical examination, improve the awareness and ability of 
          heart health.</p>
          <p class="underh3">- For college students, we can start from the frontier and development of biology, introduce the frontier and development of synthetic biology with professional in-depth language and the latest research results, such as using synthetic biology to achieve artificial life, cell engineering, tissue 
          engineering, etc., to expand students' vision and thinking. At the same time, through forums, seminars and practices, we can educate students to understand the complexity and diversity of the heart, and understand the diagnosis and treatment methods of heart diseases, such as electrocardiogram, echocardiography, heart stents, heart transplantation, etc., to enhance students' professional knowledge and skills.</p>
