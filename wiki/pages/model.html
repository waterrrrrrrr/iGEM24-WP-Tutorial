          Our project aims to provide a one-time, short-term heart disease screening solution targeted at individuals in households or communities. Therefore, during the user testing process, we need to provide clear and specific steps for operation, as well as the time intervals between each step. Our product simultaneously detects nucleic acids and proteins, so the modeling work involves determining the time points at which the electrical signals for both substances reach their peak values, facilitating the detection of results. Additionally, we need to calculate the capture efficiency of methylene blue (MB) to determine the proportion of MB added to the aptamer for further analysis.

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Binding reaction:</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">
          In the binding reaction, we use Freundlich adsorption equation to describe the strength of connection between DNA single strands, in order to simulate their opening and closing.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          The Freundlich adsorption equation is an empirical model that describes the distribution of solute on the surface of an adsorbent. Its basic form is:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'svgs/model/equation.svg')}}" alt=" " class="equation">
        </div>
        <p class="underh3">
          Where:
          <ul>
            <li>( q ) is the amount adsorbed on the adsorbent.</li>
            <li>( C ) is the concentration of solute in the liquid phase.</li>
            <li>( K_c ) is the Freundlich constant representing adsorption strength.</li>
            <li>( n ) is the non-uniformity coefficient of the Freundlich adsorption equation, typically between 1 and 10.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          The basic implementation of the Freundlich adsorption equation function is:
        </p>
        <div class="codebox">
          <pre class="underh3">
freundlich_eq = @(params, c) params(1) * c.^params(2);
          </pre>
        </div>
        <p class="underh3">
          But in our project, we need to consider the effects of temperature and pH on the binding strength of the bases. According to literature research, both temperature and pH show a linear relationship with the parameter (K_c) in the Freundlich adsorption equation within certain limits. Therefore, if we control the experimental conditions within these limits, we can simply assume a linear relationship. Hence, we need to include a parameter correction term in the code.
        </p>
        <div class="codebox">
          <pre class="underh3">
compute_K = @(base_K, temperature, pH) base_K * exp(-0.08 * (1 / (8.314 * temperature)) + 0.45 * (pH - 7));
          </pre>
        </div>
        <p class="underh3">This function takes the base constant base_K, temperature, and pH values as parameters and returns the calculated K_c for the matching reaction. In the calculation of the matching reaction, k_bind is multiplied by H2_concentration and H3_concentration, and adjusted through the call to compute_K to account for the effects of temperature and pH on the matching rate.</p>      
        <p class="underh3">This implementation allows the matching rate constant k_bind to be dynamically adjusted based on the actual experimental conditions of temperature and pH, leading to a more accurate simulation of the dynamic behavior of the matching reaction. Due to the minimal changes in temperature and pH during the reaction, using molecular dynamics simulation methods would not only be time-consuming but also yield little benefit, hence employing a simple Freundlich adsorption equation model already achieves a good simulation level.</p>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Open reaction:</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">The modeling approach for opening reaction involves simulating the twisting and opening process of DNA strands, and estimating the opening rate constant for subsequent ODE equation establishment. Firstly, we need to know the initial twist angle and centripetal force of the H1 molecule, data that can be obtained through experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography. Secondly, we can use the dipole approximation model to estimate the twist spring constant and open spring constant of this double-stranded structure. Based on this data, we can begin to simulate the opening process of this double-stranded structure.</p>

        <p class="underh3">We use a for loop to simulate the continuous traversal of this process, and the termination result is generally considered to be complete when the twist angle of the double-stranded structure exceeds 15~20 degrees, as 
        indicated in the literature. Random perturbation terms are consistently added to the model to make it closer to reality.</p>
        <p class="underh3">
          Here are some assumptions:
          <ul>
            <li>In the dipole approximation model, we assume that the torsional spring constant of DNA is the sum of the torsional spring constants of each base pair, treating the entire DNA molecule as a whole. The rationale behind this simplification is that DNA molecules are relatively large, and the interactions between base pairs can produce synergistic effects on the overall molecule. The torsional spring constant of DNA originates from the interactions between base pairs, and the dipole approximation model assumes that these interactions are uniform across the entire molecule. Therefore, the sum of the torsional spring constants can be regarded as the torsional spring constant of the DNA as a whole. This assumption simplifies the complex molecular structure, making the problem easier to handle.</li>
            <li>DNA molecules exhibit non-uniformity and require segmented consideration of their torsional spring constants and opening spring constants.</li>
            <li>The binding strength of A-T and C-G pairs are different and mutually influences each other.</li>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>Cascade reaction:</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">Due to the continuous stacking of H2 and H3 in the cascade reaction, it is possible to ensure that the detection of all miRNAs uses the same H2 and H3 by controlling the nucleic acid fragments. Additionally, the final 
        product of the HCR amplification is not clearly defined in the literature. Therefore, the rate of the cascade reaction will be determined through experimental methods by measuring the reaction rates at different temperatures and pH levels. Experimental data will be used to fit the parameters of the kinetic mode. For example, using the lsqcurvefit function in Matlab to obtain the optimal reaction rate constants.</p>

        <p class="underh3"><strong>One: Using the Michaelis-Menten Saturation Model to model the capture efficiency of MB.</strong></p>
        <p class="underh3">The Michaelis-Menten Saturation Model is a relatively simple and classic model, its equation is:</p>
        <div class="inserteq">
          <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'svgs/model/eq1.png')}}" style="width: 20%; background-color: white;" class="pic-decoration">
        </div>
        <p class="underh3">The reason we chose this equation as the model for this process is mainly based on the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saturation effect: The Michaelis-Menten model considers the saturation phenomenon of enzyme activity with increasing substrate concentration. In our context, this can reflect whether the capture efficiency of dsDNA tends to saturate as the MB concentration increases.</li>
          <li>Applicability: The model performs well in explaining saturation effects caused by interactions between substrates and enzymes or other ligands. This is consistent with our desire to understand the interaction between MB and dsDNA.</li>
          <li>Interpretability of parameters: The parameters of the Michaelis-Menten model, such as V_max and K_m, have biological or chemical interpretability, providing useful information about the characteristics of the capture system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="underh3">We are interested in the variation of MB capture efficiency on dsDNA at different MB concentrations. We aim to achieve optimal results with the lowest economic cost, so I introduced a weight factor in the code. An exponential decay function is used to reduce the weight of MB quantity when calculating the total capture amount. By adjusting experimental parameters, we hope to find the optimal MB concentration, where the concentration of MB is relatively low and its capture amount is relatively large.</p>
