          Heart disease is the main type of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease can be divided into congenital heart disease (congenital malformation) and acquired heart disease. Among them, acquired heart disease accounts for the majority, such as coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, sick sinus syndrome and so on, which causes atrial fibrillation, heart failure and other symptoms.
        </p>
        <p class="underh2">
          At present, the diagnosis of heart disease is mainly based on clinical symptoms (such as chest pain, dyspnea, etc.), physical examination (heart murmur, hypertension, etc.) and electrocardiogram (ECG). However, these methods have some shortcomings, such as <strong>low timeliness</strong> (usually the results can only be diagnosed when the disease is serious), <strong>complicated operation, need of professionals and long-term monitoring alone, ect</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="underh2">
          Therefore, in order to achieve the purpose of<strong> early detection and early treatment</strong> and make up for some shortcomings of traditional methods, we need to seek a more rapid and convenient detection method to achieve the effect of <strong>early census</strong>.

          Under normal circumstances, various substances in the human body are in a state of dynamic balance. However, when there are some problems with our body, such as heart disease, the concentration of some substances will change significantly. This is the basis of our project design.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          The synthesis and secretion of proteins are regulated in vivo, and when diseases occur, these physiological activities may be out of balance. Taking natriuretic peptide (BNP) as an example: the neuroendocrine system is activated in heart failure. At the same time, due to the increase of ventricular volume or pressure load, the tension of ventricular wall increases, which will increase the concentration of BNP in blood.[1]
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          Besides proteins, RNAs can also be used as our target. MiRNAs, a kind of non-coding RNAs, play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.Many miRNAs have been proved to be effective targets for diagnosis or treatment of various diseases. [2]
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          CircRNAs regulate gene expression in many ways. It has been found that most circRNA have the specificity of tissue and blood samples and can participate in regulating related diseases. [3]

        </h3>
        <p class="underh3">
          Aptamer (Aptamer) is a single strand oligonucleotide that can bind specifically to the target molecule.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          The principle of aptamer recognition of target molecules: single-chain oligonucleotides form a specific three-dimensional structure after self-adaptive folding through nucleotide base complementary pairing, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic force and other interaction forces, and this three-dimensional structure is specifically bound to the target molecule through intermolecular force. Its binding dissociation constant can reach nM and pM levels, which is comparable to that of monoclonal antibody.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          Compared with antibodies, aptamers have many advantages, such as a wider range of target molecules, better thermal stability, smaller molecular weight, chemical synthesis, small batch differences, easy modification, and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="underh3">
          Because of these advantages of aptamers in target detection, we chose aptamers as the core detection element of our project.
