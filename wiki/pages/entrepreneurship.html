        <p class="underh3">Conduct market research to determine the target audience, market size, and potential demand for our products. This helps us to understand the current market situation and regulatory considerations, and to develop and improve our products according to needs.</p>
<p class="underh3">The market research plan is as follows:</p>
<p class="underh3">1. Clarify the purpose of market research: to understand the incidence of heart disease, the characteristics of patients, the habits of diagnosis and treatment, the preferences and needs of consumers, the products and 
strategies of competitors, the size and growth potential of the market, the impact of policies and regulations.</p>
<p class="underh3">2. Set the objectives of market research: determine the target market and market segment of the product, determine the pricing and positioning of the product, and formulate marketing and promotion strategies.</p>      
<p class="underh3">3. Design and use market research methods and tools. We will select the appropriate market research methods and tools to collect and analyze the data and information required for the project. Our methods of market research are divided into primary research and secondary research. Primary research refers to the original data collected directly from consumers or relevant people in the target market, such as obtaining feedback and opinions from potential customers through questionnaires, interviews, observations, experiments, etc. 
Secondary research refers to data and information obtained from existing data sources, such as industry reports, government statistics, academic papers, Internet searches and other sources to obtain the prevalence of heart disease trends, market competition, policy changes, etc. We will select appropriate data sources and sampling methods, and design appropriate data collection and analysis tools to organize, analyze and visualize the data.</p>
<p class="underh3">4. Ensure the quality and validity of data: ensure the representativeness and randomness of samples, avoid data bias and error, and protect data security and privacy.</p>
<p class="underh3">5. Analyze and interpret data and draw conclusions: We will 
use appropriate statistical methods and techniques, descriptive analysis of data, inferential analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, etc., to reveal the law and trend of data, test our assumptions and expectations, and evaluate the market potential and competitive advantage of our products. Finally, the target market and market segment, market share and growth rate forecast, product pricing and positioning suggestions, marketing and promotion strategies and measures.</p>
<p class="underh3">6. We will also monitor and evaluate the progress and effect of market research in a timely manner, and make necessary adjustments and improvements according to the actual situation.</p>

          <p class="underh3">76.12% of respondents were familiar with heart disease, suffered from it themselves or had heard of someone suffering from it.</p>
          <p class="underh3">Among them, 36.82% of the respondents believe that heart disease is very common and many people have it.</p>
          <p class="underh3">In addition, 23.88% of people think that heart-related diseases are very distant and have not been heard of.</p>
          <p class="underh3">It can be seen that heart-related diseases are common in people's lives, but there are still some people who lack awareness of this.</p>

        <p class="underh3">52.28% of respondents had symptoms of tachycardia, palpitation and palpitation.</p>

        <p class="underh3">The number of people who chose to have a physical examination more than 3 years accounted for 4.48%, which is a relatively small proportion of people.</p>
        <p class="underh3">It can be seen from the data that most people do not attach much importance to physical examination, and relatively few people maintain regular physical examination habits. This shows that it is very necessary to strengthen health education and physical examination publicity and raise public awareness of the importance of physical examination, and the application of this project product in the early screening of the risk of heart-related diseases is closely related to it.</p>

<p class="underh3">1. Preparation for approval: Before starting clinical trials, adequate preliminary preparation is required. This includes formulating the test plan, determining the purpose of the study, formulating the test design, and clarifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the test. At the same time, the trial plan needs to be submitted to the ethics committee and approved to ensure that the trial complies with ethical requirements and regulations.</p>
<p class="underh3">2. Subject recruitment: Once the trial protocol is approved, subject recruitment can begin. Patients or volunteers who fit the inclusion criteria were recruited as trial participants. At this stage, the subjects need to be informed in detail, to ensure that they understand the purpose, process, risks and benefits of the trial, and to sign informed consent.</p>
<p class="underh3">3. Trial execution: During the trial execution phase, subjects were randomized to receive different interventions, such as receiving a 
device product or a control group (conventional treatment or placebo). During the execution of the trial, the trial was carried out in strict accordance with the trial protocol and operating procedures, including medical intervention, data collection and recording.</p>
<p class="underh3">4. Data collection and monitoring: During the trial, the data of the subjects will be collected and monitored to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data. At the same time, the safety of the test process was monitored, and adverse events were found and dealt with in time.</p>        
<p class="underh3">5. Data analysis and interpretation of results: After the test, statistical analysis of the test data was carried out to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the test products. Draw conclusions and interpret test results through data analysis.</p>
<p class="underh3">6. Report writing and submission: Write the test report and submit the test results to the regulatory authority for approval. The report should include information on the purpose, method, results, conclusions, and safety of the trial.</p>
<p class="underh3">7. Follow-up and long-term observation: After the conclusion of the trial, long-term follow-up and observation may be required to further evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the trial product.</p>
<p class="underh3">8. Registration and publication: Upon completion of a clinical trial, the results of the trial may be registered and published in a scientific journal in accordance with appropriate policy requirements and scientific ethics.</p>
